# USB_MicroSD_CardReader

## Description:
This is an USB MicroSD Card Reader mad with the GL823K IC.The footprint of the SD card holder was made by me, andI made it by mistake with a solder mask cover, witch had to be removed from it before soldering the socket. The [first version](https://github.com/Tonikiller10000/USB-MicroSD_CardReader/blob/main/SD_Card_Pictures/p.png) was just for testing, trying to use the GPIO pin of the IC, but unfortunately it didn\`t worked.

At the second version, I remake the SD card holder footprint, added some holes for a 3D case and used differential pairs for the USB data lines.<br>

## Results:
Overall, the board work\`s verry well, and I am very happy of how it turned out. I have to wait the second board to arrive, and I have to make the 3D case.
