# USB_MicroSD_CardReader

## Description:
This is an USB MicroSD Card Reader mad with the GL823K IC.The footprint of the SD card holder was made by me and at the v1.0, it was made by mistake with a mask cover, witch had to be removed from it before soldering the socket. The first version was just for testing, trying to use the GPIO pin of the IC, but unfortunately it didn\`t worked. At the second version, I added also some holes for a 3D case.
