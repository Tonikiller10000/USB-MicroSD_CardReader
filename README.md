# USB_MicroSD_CardReader

## Description:
This is an USB MicroSD Card Reader mad with the GL823K IC.The footprint of the SD card holder was made by me and at the v1.0, it was made by mistake with a mask cover, witch had to be removed from it before soldering the socket. The first version was just for testing, trying to use the GPIO pin of the IC, but unfortunately it didn\`t worked. <br>
Overall, the board work\`s verry well, and I am very happy of how it turned out.

## V2.0
At the second version, I remake the SD card holder footprint, added some holes for a 3D case and used differential pairs for the USB data lines.<br>
The board has to arrive, and the case to be made.
