# USB_MicroSD_CardReader

## Description:
This is an USB MicroSD Card Reader mad with the GL823K IC. 
The footprint of the SD card holder was made by me, and I made it by mistake with a solder mask cover, witch had to be removed from it before soldering the socket. <br>  

## USB_MicroSD_CardReader V1.0
The [first version](https://github.com/Tonikiller10000/USB-MicroSD_CardReader/blob/main/SD_Card_Pictures/p.png) was just for testing, trying to use the GPIO pin of the IC, but unfortunately, because of the poor quality of the datasheet, it didn\`t worked. <br>

## USB_MicroSD_CardReader V2.0
At the second version, I remake the SD card holder footprint, added some holes for a 3D case and used differential pairs for the USB data lines.<br>

## Results:
I have to wait the second board to arrive, and to make the 3D case for it, but overall, the board work\`s verry well, and I am very happy of how it turned out.
